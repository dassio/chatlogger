Great! I can see that your project is already set up for building VSIX packages. The `package.json` has the necessary scripts and dependencies. Let me check if there are any build scripts or additional configuration files.

Read file: tsconfig.json

Perfect! Your project is already configured for building VSIX packages. Here's how to build your extension to VSIX format:

## Step 1: Build the TypeScript code


---

```bash
npm run build
```

```
danny@home:~/programming/cursor/chatlogger$ npm run build

> chatlogger@0.1.0 build
> tsc

danny@home:~/programming/cursor/chatlogger$
```

---

## Step 2: Package the extension to VSIX format


---

```bash
npm run package
```

```
danny@home:~/programming/cursor/chatlogger$ npm run package

> chatlogger@0.1.0 package
> vsce package
